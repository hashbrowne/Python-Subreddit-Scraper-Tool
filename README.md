# Python-Subreddit-Scraper-Tool
Python scraping tool that pulls thread data from a given subreddit and saves to a .csv file.

In order to run, you'll need to register an app/script on reddit's developer page.

Once created, replace the CLIENT_ID, CLIENT_SECRET, username, and password with your information. You can set the user_agent as the name of your project.

Make sure to change the .csv file name each run so you don't end up with a duplicate file error.
